<title>Status LEDs</title>
<para>There are 3 LEDs:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>After reset, the status LED flashes twice in 200ms, and then every 400ms until the capacitors have charged. When the system is operating normally the LED will flash every second</listitem>
<listitem>the short LED shows when the fuel cell is shorted. This maintains proper temperature and humidity inside the stack</listitem>
<listitem>the purge LED shows when the purge valve operates</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<title>Purge</title>
<para>Every few minutes, you will hear a short "hiss" as the purge valves open. This purging allows fresh hydrogen to flow in to the stack.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Waste water</title>
<para>The by-product of the electrochemical reaction is a small amount of water. This is released through the vents on both sides of the stack. The larger the electrical load, the more water will be produced. This small amount of water usually evaporates, however occasionally under high load, droplets are formed therefore the stack should not be placed in a moisture sensitive area.</para>
</sect2>

<title>Output power</title>
<para>
With the system running without a computer (standalone), the Arduino will be drawing about 0.25W, so with a single stack expected output power will be 1.25W. With a 3W system, output power will be 2.75W.
</para>

<title>Overload protection</title>
<para>
If the stack voltage drops too low due to being overloaded or externally short-circuited, the stack control shield will disconnect the load. If you have a terminal window open, a warning message will be displayed.

<title>Monitoring fuel cell status</title>

<para>The fuel cell status (stack voltage and current) is displayed by default in the Arduino Serial Monitor. For further information, please see software documentation.</para>
